            <p>Ah, Chiang Mai. How do I love thee? You are earthen and sacred, dusted in dew and crowned with nature. Maybe that's why you're a <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/ten-places-to-go-if-world-goes-to-crap-2009-10?op=1" target="_blank" title="top place to go if the world goes to hell">top place to go if the world goes to hell</a>, but hell, you're a haven on the world's best of days.</p>

<h2 id="the-typical-fare">The Typical Fare</h2>

<p>The classic guide books would march you through <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g7702231-d447417-Reviews-Umbrella_Village_Bor_Sang-Bo_Sang_San_Kamphaeng.html" target="_blank" title="umbrella factories">umbrella factories</a> and <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Travel-g293917-c127870/Chiang-Mai:Thailand:Elephant.Camps.Chiang.Mai.html" target="_blank" title="elephant camps">elephant camps</a> before busing you to a <a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/thailand/chiang-mai-province/chiang-mai/activities/food-drink/traditional-khantoke-dinner-show-chiang-mai" target="_blank" title="Kantoke cultural show">Kantoke cultural show</a> and then dropping you off at the <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293917-d447327-Reviews-Night_Bazaar-Chiang_Mai.html" target="_blank" title="night bazaar">night bazaar</a>.</p>

<p>Don't get me wrong, all of those things are great. They will make you fall in love with this city like it's a hot girl on a magazine in the checkout aisle. But I love this city like it's a book I'll never finish and I've gone to bed with every night. I've explored its every avenue, savored its every delicious twist and turn, and still it never ceases to amaze me. That love is what I want to share  with you.</p>

<p class="caption">Florescent signs illuminate dried fruit and spices at Warorot market</p>

<h2 id="day-1-market--river">Day 1: Market &amp; River</h2>

<h4 id="morning-at-the-market">Morning at the Market</h4>

<p>Start your day at <a href="https://migrationology.com/warorot-market-chiang-mai/" target="_blank" title="Warorot market">Warorot market</a>, entering from Kuang Men Road just off Tapae Road. Browse the textiles and plastics before venturing into the 3-story mecca of dried foods, spices, housewares, fireworks, and school uniforms that is Warorot proper. Continue weaving your way toward the river and past the vendor selling delicious fried insects before coming out at the flower market which lines both sides of Praisanee Road.</p>

<h4 id="lunch--treats">Lunch &amp; Treats</h4>

<p>Use your last burst of energy to cross the Nawarat bridge and stagger into <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293917-d878209-r145023668-Wawee_Coffee-Chiang_Mai.html" target="_blank" title="Wawee Coffee">Wawee Coffee</a> for a refreshing iced drink and river view. If you're ready for lunch, jump on a songtaew going north and get off at <a href="http://eatingtheglobe.com/favorite-khao-soi-chiang-mai/" target="_blank" title="Khao Soi Lam Duan">Khao Soi Lam Duan</a> for an authentic bowl of <i>khao soi</i>: soft and crispy noodles in a curry broth and topped with pickled vegetables. If you prefer more familiar fare, skip the songtaew and weave through the back streets to <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293917-d1081063-Reviews-Bake_and_Bite-Chiang_Mai.html" target="_blank" title="Bake n' Bite">Bake n' Bite</a> for cafe-style breakfasts and sandwiches.</p>

<p>After lunch, follow Charoen Rat on foot to browse any art galleries that are open and end up at <a href="http://www.vjoteahouse.com/" target="_blank" title="Vieng Joom On Tea House">Vieng Joom On Tea House</a> for an afternoon refreshment on their gorgeous, billowy patio. If you have it in you, song taew or tuk tuk a few minutes south to <a href="http://chiangmai-artinparadise.com/" target="_blank" title="Art in Paradise">Art in Paradise</a>, an interactive art exhibit of 3-dimensional optical illusions painted to serve as photo backdrops.</p>

<p>At this point, any normal person should be sweaty and exhausted and ready for a quick cool off at their hotel before venturing back out for dinner.</p>

<h4 id="dinner--shopping">Dinner &amp; Shopping</h4>

<p>Return to the river area around dinnertime to dine  at either<a href="http://wherestheduke.com" target="_blank" title="The Duke's">The Duke's</a> for indulgent, delicious American good or aboard the river "cruise" that leaves from the <a href="http://www.theriversidechiangmai.com/4-1-nightly_cruise.php" target="_blank" title="Riverside">Riverside</a> every night at 8. Cruisegoers may want to stop in or call ahead since the cruise is in fact just a riverboat that seats maybe 40.</p>

<p>After dinner, go ahead and head to the super touristy <a href="http://www.1stopchiangmai.com/shopping/night_market" target="_blank" title="night bazaar">night bazaar</a>; no trip to Chiang Mai is complete without it. You can walk the 15 minutes if you're so inclined, or tuk tuks and song taews should be ubiquitous. Don't feel obligated to shut it down; do stay long enough to enjoy banana roti from the stall that's in front of McDonald's.</p>

<p class="caption">Buddha statues sit in a row at Wat Phra That Doi Suthep</p>

<h2 id="day-2-nimman--cmu">Day 2: Nimman &amp; CMU</h2>

<h4 id="breakfast--lunch">Breakfast &amp; Lunch</h4>

<p>Start your day on the north end of Nimman at <a href="http://www.ristr8to-coffee-chiangmai.com/" target="_blank" title="Ristr8o">Ristr8o</a> for a coffee snob-approved single origin latte and award-winning <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ristr8to/" target="_blank" title="latte art">latte artist</a> Arnon Thitprasert <i>or</i> hit up its nearby younger brother, the experimental <a href="http://bk.asia-city.com/travel/news/ristr8to-now-has-spin" target="_blank" title="Ristr8to Lab">Ristr8to Lab</a>. Next, head 1 block north to <a href="http://www.nimmansoi1.com/" target="_blank" title="Nimman Soi 1">Nimman Soi 1</a>, a street known for trendy boutiques and craft textiles. Then, circle back and stop in at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/guufusionrotiandtea/" target="_blank" title="Guu Fusion Roti and Tea">Guu Fusion Roti and Tea</a> for a mid-morning fix of flaky fried dough.</p>

<p>Afterward, make your way west along Nimmanhaemin proper and stop in at some of the boutiques along the way, such as Chabaa (bohemian apparel) or Pink Pussy (loud and proud outrageous jewelry). Arrive for lunch at <a href="http://www.thesaladconcept.com/about.php" target="_blank" title="Salad Concept">Salad Concept</a>, before exploring the current exhibit at <a href="http://www.sangdeegallery.org/" target="_blank" title="Sangdee Cafe and Art Gallery">Sangdee Cafe and Art Gallery</a>. Continue weaving through back streets to find <a href="http://tableforthreeplease.com/2011/01/chiang-mai-iberry-garden/" target="_blank" title="iBerry">iBerry</a> for exotic ice cream flavors (spicy mango? salty pomelo?) and a photoshoot in their surrealist garden (designed by its founder comedian Nate Udom) that was basically made to be instagrammed.</p>

<p>If you actually expect to relax on vacation, head next to one of the many nail salons or spas in the area and rejoin the itinerary later. Otherwise, continue on to the CMU area and up Doi Suthep.</p>

<h4 id="afternoon-up-the-mountain">Afternoon Up the Mountain</h4>

<p>Take a moto or songtaew the 20 minutes up Doi Suthep, the mountain just north of town. Pitstop at the <a href="http://www.thiswaytoparadise.com/chiang-mai-wat-phrathat-doi-suthep-huay-kaew-waterfall/" target="_blank" title="Huay Gaew waterfall">Huay Gaew waterfall</a> before continuing to <a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/thailand/chiang-mai-province/chiang-mai/sights/religious/wat-phra-that-doi-suthep" target="_blank" title="Wat Phra That Doi Suthep">Wat Phra That Doi Suthep</a>, a once-sacred temple that is now equal parts place of worship and tourist attraction. As tourists, expect to sweat your way up 309 steps and then shell out a small entrance fee. Afterwards, if you're still enjoying the muggy mountain air, you may choose to visit the unfortunately-named <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293917-d1760058-Reviews-Bhubing_Palace-Chiang_Mai.html" target="_blank" title="Bhubing Palace">Bhubing Palace</a>, a royal palace with impressive rose gardens, but be warned that they have strict rules against shorts, short skirts, and sleeveless tops.</p>

<h4 id="dinner--dessert">Dinner &amp; Dessert</h4>

<p>In the evening, head toward Chiang Mai University for a sit or stroll in the park by the <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293917-d8826313-Reviews-Ang_Kaew_Reservoir-Chiang_Mai.html" tartget="_blank" title="reservoir">reservoir</a> on campus. Then, walk across the street to the <a href="http://www.paperplanesblog.com/student-market/" target="_blank" title="university night market">university night market</a>, which favors hipster and anime kitch over the touristy knick knacks you'll find elsewhere. Grab dinner in the outdoor food court, such as <i>moo ga ta</i>, or meat cooked yourself on a tabletop grill. End the night back on Nimman at <a href="http://www.mont-nomsod.com/home.html" title="Mont Nom Sod">Mont Nom Sod</a> (มนต์ นมสด) which led the trend in fancy toast and flavored milk.</p>

<p><img src="/images/201607-36-hours/cooking-class.jpg" alt="aspiring chef makes big flame in wok during thai cooking class" class="banner" /></p>

<p class="caption">An aspiring chef makes a big flame in a wok during a Thai cooking class</p>

<h2 id="day-3-tapae">Day 3: Tapae</h2>

<h4 id="coffee--class">Coffee &amp; Class</h4>
<p>Get an early start at one of <a href="http://www.paperplanesblog.com/50-of-the-best-cafes-in-chiang-mai/" target="_blank" title="Chiang Mai's best coffee shops">Chiang Mai's best coffee shops</a>; the quality-obsessed <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ponganesespressobar/" target="_blank" title="Ponganese">Ponganese</a> or the social enterprise <a href="http://www.akhaama.com/" target="_blank" title="Akha Ama">Akha Ama</a> are both good choices. Then spend your day at a cooking class, like one offered by <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293917-d1115891-Reviews-Chiang_Mai_Thai_Cookery_School-Chiang_Mai.html" target="_blank" title="Chiang Mai Thai Cookery School">Chiang Mai Thai Cookery School</a>. (While not the cheapest option, in my opinions, this is one of the best. Other options abound; any will be entertaining and perhaps even educational.)</p>

<p>If cooking is not your thing, consider a 1-day massage class or fruit carving class. For the adrenaline junkie, consider trekking, <a href="http://www.thailandclimbing.com/climb-crazy-horse/" target="_blank" title="rock climbing">rock climbing</a>, or <a href="https://www.treetopasia.com/thailand-holiday/chiang-mai" target="_blank" title="zip-lining through the jungle">zip-lining through the jungle</a>. Any travel agent in the Tapae area can make a booking for you and prices typically range from $20-60 for a 1-day activity. Advanced bookings are helpful but day-of is possible if you get an early start.</p>

<p>If you find yourself with time in the Tapae area, you'll notice <i>wats</i>, or temples, on just about every corner. Within the old city, a one square mile area surrounded by a moat, are more temples than you could see in a day, most of which you can simply walk in to.</p>

<h4 id="dinner--drinks">Dinner &amp; Drinks</h4>
<p>End your day at the chichi <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293917-d3715658-Reviews-Ginger_Kafe-Chiang_Mai.html" target="_blank" title="Ginger &amp; Cafe">Ginger &amp; Cafe</a> for exquite food and dinks or, for a more casual option, consider checking out <a href="http://dashteakhouse.com/" target="_blank" title="Dash">Dash</a>. Afterward, hop on a songtaew or walk the mile-ish to <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293917-d3743573-Reviews-The_North_Gate_Jazz_Club-Chiang_Mai.html" target="_blank" title="North Gate Jazz">North Gate Jazz</a>, a hole in the wall hopping jazz club that is beloved by Thais and tourists alike.</p>

<p><img src="/images/201607-36-hours/walking-street-3.jpg" alt="tribal clothes and accessories make an appearance at sunday night walking street" class="banner" /></p>

<p class="caption">Fisherman pants and Thai tribal handiwork make appearances at Sunday night walking street</p>

<h2 id="thursday--sunday">Thursday &amp; Sunday</h2>
<p>If your trip affords you the opportunity, mingle with an eclectic expat crowd upstairs at the <a href="http://www.unirishpub.com/" target="_blank" title="UN Irish Pub">UN Irish Pub</a> pub quiz every Thursday night.</p>

<p>Do everything you can to experience the hustle and bustle of <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1308496-d945764-Reviews-Sunday_Night_Market_Walking_Street_Tha_Pae_Gate-Chiang_Mai_Province.html" target="_blank" title="Sunday night walking street">Sunday night walking street</a>. Beat the rush by starting promptly at 5pm, but don't be surprised when foot traffic slows to a crawl around 8. Shop from local artists and craftspeople, many of whom may do this as a side gig, and enjoy the full range of available street food. When pedestrians freeze in their tracks at 6pm, you're not being punked; it's a moment of respect paid twice daily during a broadcast of the national anthem. You should follow suit. Once you've shopped till you dropped, don't be ashamed to take refuge in a foot massage before squeezing in just a <i>liiiittle more.</i></p>

<p><img src="/images/201607-36-hours/elephants-2.jpg" alt="mother and baby elephant at an elephant camp near chiang mai" class="banner" /></p>

<p class="caption">Mother and baby elephant at an elephant camp near Chiang Mai</p>

<h2 id="get-out-of-town">Get Out of Town</h2>

<h4 id="north-samoeng-loop-12-day">North Samoeng Loop (1/2 Day)</h4>

<p><i>Best tackled with your own transportation or a day-long songtaew hire.</i></p>

<p>Start mid morning with a drive through the mountains to arrive at <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1766192-d4322964-Reviews-Doi_Mon_Cham-Mae_Rim.html" target="_blank" title="Doi Mon Chaem and the Nong Hoi Royal Project">Doi Mon Chaem and the Nong Hoi Royal Project</a> in time for lunch in a hut overlooking a luscious fertile valley. If you haven't already overdosed on gardens, return by way of the <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1766192-d548427-Reviews-Queen_Sirikit_Botanic_Garden-Mae_Rim.html" target="_blank" title="Queen Sirikit Botanical Gardens">Queen Sirikit Botanical Gardens</a>. Afterwards, stop off in Mae Rim at <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/LocationPhotoDirectLink-g1766192-d3946130-i88121884-Wawee_Coffee-Mae_Rim.html" target="_blank" title="Suan Lahu Cafe' @ Tita Gallery">Suan Lahu Cafe' @ Tita Gallery</a>, a serene, tucked-away art gallery and coffee shop.</p>

<h4 id="northeast-nature-1-day">Northeast Nature (1 Day)</h4>

<p><i>Best tackled with your own transportation or a day-long songtaew hire.</i></p>

<p>Head northeast from Chiang Mai and pick up a <i>som tam</i> picnic on the way to <a href="http://tielandtothailand.com/bua-tong-sticky-waterfalls-chiang-mai/" target="_blank" title="Bua Tong Waterfall and Chet Si Spring">Bua Tong Waterfall and Chet Si Spring</a>. This waterfall's limestone surface means you can climb up and down it spiderman-style and gives it its English moniker <i>sticky falls</i>. Next, head to the <a href="http://tielandtothailand.com/mae-ngat-dam-floating-houses-chiang-mai/" target="_blank" title="Mae Ngat Dam">Mae Ngat Dam</a> and rent a houseboat for the day. Docks allow for swimming, jumping and sunbathing; the park also offers a full-service restaurant and the option to stay overnight.</p>

<h4 id="city-south-12-day">City South (1/2 Day)</h4>

<p><i>With the exception of Wat Doi Kam, most of these places are more or less accessible by public transportation.</i></p>

<p>Spend an afternoon at <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293917-d1699367-Reviews-Central_Airport_Plaza-Chiang_Mai.html" target="_blank" title="Central Airport Plaza">Central Airport Plaza</a>, just one of many modern malls in Chiang Mai, but be sure to check out the Northern Village area which boast all the best food and wares from markets around town, but in the bliss of air conditioned comfort. From there, you can drive to the top (or walk from the base) of <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293917-d1754563-Reviews-Wat_Phra_That_Doi_Kham_Temple_of_the_Golden_Mountain-Chiang_Mai.html" target="_blank">Wat Doi Kham</a> just before sunset to enjoy a quiet temple and stunning views pretty much all to yourself. Drive down the mountain to dine among jungle plants and water features at <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293917-d2659338-Reviews-Khaomao_Khaofang_Restaurant-Chiang_Mai.html" target="_blank" title="Kao Mao Kao Fang">Kao Mao Kao Fang</a>. Finally, end the day at the <a href="http://www.chiangmainightsafari.com/" target="_blank" title="Night Safari">Night Safari</a>, for an impressive noctural animal display. Unless, of course, you've been to its rival in Singapore, in which case you should prepare to be disappointed.</p>

<h4 id="elephant-conservation-center-12-day-or-more">Elephant Conservation Center (1/2 Day or more)</h4>

<p>It might be cliche, but by all means <i>do</i> go see elephants on your trip. Any number of tours exist that will take you to any number of elephant camps, which are a confusing combination of camp-as-in-summer-camp and camp-as-in-internment-camp. I really don't know and I've been to <i>all of them</i>. Many times. I hear good things about the <a href="http://www.thailandelephant.org/en/index.html" target="_blank" title="Thai Elephant Conservation Center">Thai Elephant Conservation Center</a>, which also offers homestays and multiday mahout training experiences.</p>

<h4 id="doi-inthanon-12-day-or-more">Doi Inthanon (1/2 Day or more)</h4>

<p><i>This mountainous drive is best tackled with a rental car, hired van, or on a tour.</i></p>

<p>Drive up Thailand's tallest mountain <a href="https://www.thainationalparks.com/doi-inthanon-national-park" target="_blank" title="Doi Inthanon">Doi Inthanon</a> for a chance to feel–believe it or not–a brisk chill. Drink hot cocoa at the top of the mountain, walk through a jungle boardwalk, and detour by myriad waterfalls. You can detour by the <a href="http://www.tourismthailand.org/Attraction/Doi-Inthanon-Royal-Project--159" target="_blank" title="Doi Inthanon Royal Project">Doi Inthanon Royal Project</a>, including extensive gardens, agricultural projects, and several <a href="http://www.royal-inthanon.com/Club/House" target="blank" title="Doi Inthanon Bungalows">bungalows</a> where you can stay overnight. <a href="http://www.adventureinyou.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-camping-at-doi-inthanon-national-park/" target="_blank" title="Doi Inthanon Camping">Camping opportunities</a>, including gear rental, also exist for the more intrepid travellers.</p>

<h4 id="pai-2-3-days">Pai (2-3 Days)</h4>

<p><i>A three-hour bus ride departs from the main bus stations multiple times daily.</i></p>

<p>The road from Chiang Mai to <a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/thailand/mae-hong-son-province/pai/introduction" target="_blank" title="Pai">Pai</a> is known for its 762 curves as you weave through mountains to arrive at this hippy haven. Go trekking or tubing, or savor the slower pace of life, coffee shops and art scene.</p>
